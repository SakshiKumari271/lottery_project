🎰 Lottery & Probability Simulator (Python)

“Winning the lottery is luck. Understanding probability is skill.” 🎯

This project is a Python-based lottery simulation that demonstrates probability, randomness, and statistical outcomes through repeated trials. It helps visualize how rare winning combinations really are — using code, not guesswork.

🚀 Project Highlights

✨ Simulates a real lottery system (6 numbers from 1–49)
✨ Repeats draws millions of times to calculate probability
✨ Tracks match statistics (0–6 matches)
✨ Beginner-friendly, clean Python code
✨ Strong foundation project for Data Science & Python learners
